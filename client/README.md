This is the React frontend for the Job Board application, built with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- `lucide-react` (for icons)
- `react-router-dom` (for routing)

## Setup

1.  Navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## Building for Production

This command bundles the application into the `dist` directory for deployment.
